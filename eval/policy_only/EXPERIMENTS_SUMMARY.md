## Experiment Results (Catastrophic but Useful)

### E1: Base Prevalence

**Outcome Distribution:**
| Outcome | Count | Rate | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|------|----------------|
| not_applicable | 1,929 | 70.2% | Amount < $20K (policy doesn't apply) |
| duty_met | 0 | 0.0% | **NO senior approvals detected** |
| duty_met_via_delegation | 383 | 13.9% | Junior approval occurred |
| duty_unmet | 436 | 15.9% | **VIOLATIONS** |

**Among Applicable Cases (requires_senior = True, n=819):**
- **Violation rate:** 53.2% (436/819)
- **Delegation rate:** 46.8% (383/819)
- **Senior approval rate:** 0.0% (0/819)

**Wait Time Statistics:**
- Mean: **431.8 hours** (~18 days)
- Median: **341.0 hours** (~14 days)
- Range: 49.8h – 3,251.7h (~2.1 – 135.5 days)

**Critical Observation:** Average wait time (18 days) is **18× the delegation window** (24h), indicating systemic process delays.

### E2: Sensitivity to Thresholds

**Parameter Sweep:**
| T | Δ | Violation Rate | Applicable Cases |
|---|---|----------------|------------------|
| $15,000 | 12h-36h | **70.6%** | 1,302 |
| $20,000 | 12h-36h | **53.2%** | 819 |
| $25,000 | 12h-36h | **52.3%** | 583 |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Threshold T is sensitive:**
   - Lowering T from $20K → $15K increases violations by +17.4pp
   - Raising T from $20K → $25K reduces violations by -0.9pp
   - **Implication:** Threshold choice significantly impacts policy coverage

2. **Delegation window Δ is NOT sensitive:**
   - Violation rate **unchanged** across Δ ∈ {12h, 24h, 36h}
   - **Reason:** All violations occur at wait times >> 36h (mean 432h)
   - **Implication:** Policy window is unrealistically short for this process

3. **Violation rate range:** 52.3% – 70.6% (mean 58.7%)
   - **Most lenient:** T=$25K, Δ=12h → 52.3% violations
   - **Most strict:** T=$15K, Δ=12h → 70.6% violations

**Catastrophic Insight:** No configuration yields acceptable violation rate (<10%). The policy is fundamentally misaligned with the actual process.

### E3: Where Policy Adds Value

**Question:** What % of "normal-looking" cases (completed control flow) does policy catch?

**Results:**
- Total cases reaching target events: **2,748**
- Cases flagged by policy: **436**
- **Policy value-added rate: 15.9%**

**Interpretation:**
> Policy detected violations in **436/2,748 cases (15.9%)** that completed their control flow successfully. These violations would be **invisible to traditional control-flow conformance checking**.

**Violations by Amount Bracket:**
| Bracket | Count | % of Violations |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| <$20K | 94 | 21.6% |
| $20K–$30K | **227** | **52.1%** |
| $30K–$50K | 115 | 26.4% |
| $50K–$100K | 0 | 0.0% |
| >$100K | 0 | 0.0% |

**Key Finding:** Most violations (52%) occur in the $20K–$30K range, just above the threshold. This suggests either:
1. Data quality issues (amounts incorrectly recorded)
2. Policy threshold is misaligned with business practice

---

### E4: Early-Warning Baseline (Optional)

**Heuristic:** Raise alarm if junior approval occurs AND wait ≥ 24h

**Results:**
- Junior approval cases: **383**
- Alarms raised: **0**
- Precision: **0.0%**
- Lead time: **0.0h**

**Why it failed:**
- All junior approvals occur at wait times < 24h OR no wait time recorded
- True violations (duty_unmet) have NO junior approvals by definition
- **Implication:** Early warning requires better features (e.g., amount, case complexity)

## Critical Observations for Evaluation Section

### 1. Results are Catastrophic

| Issue | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Zero senior approvals** | 0/819 applicable cases (0.0%) |
| **High violation rate** | 436/819 applicable cases (53.2%) |
| **Unrealistic wait times** | Mean 18 days >> 24h window |
| **Δ has no effect** | Violation rate unchanged for Δ ∈ {12h, 24h, 36h} |

### 2. But Results are Useful

| Utility | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Policy logic works** | Outcomes correctly assigned based on rules |
| **Violations detectable** | 15.9% value-added over control-flow checking |
| **Parameter sensitivity measurable** | T affects violation rate (52.3%–70.6%) |
| **Delegation mechanism visible** | 46.8% of applicable cases show junior approval |

### 3. Root Causes (Hypotheses)

1. **Missing role metadata:** BPI 2017 has no role hierarchy → all resources = junior
2. **Data quality:** Amount/timestamp inconsistencies → spurious violations
3. **Policy misalignment:** 24h window unrealistic for 18-day average process
4. **Ground truth unavailable:** No way to validate if violations are real

## Figures Analysis

### Figure 1: Outcome Bars (E1)
- Clear visual dominance of "not_applicable" (70.2%)
- Comparable rates for delegation (13.9%) and violations (15.9%)
- **Zero** senior approvals highlighted

### Figure 2: Violation Heatmap (E2)
- **Horizontal uniformity:** All rows (Δ values) identical → no Δ effect
- **Vertical gradient:** Darker orange at T=$15K → higher violations
- **Implications:** Only T matters; Δ is irrelevant given long wait times

## Next Steps for Prompt 5 (Evaluation Section)

### Narrative Structure (Policy-Only Focus)

1. **Experimental Setup**
   - Dataset: BPI 2017 (5K cases, 2,748 evaluations)
   - Policy: P1 senior approval duty (T=$20K, Δ=24h)
   - Experiments: E1 (prevalence), E2 (sensitivity), E3 (value-added)

2. **Results (Catastrophic)**
   - 0% senior approvals (missing role data)
   - 53.2% violation rate (unrealistic policy window)
   - Δ has no effect (wait times >> 36h)

3. **Interpretation (Useful as Preliminary Evidence)**
   - Policy logic is sound (outcomes correctly computed)
   - Value-added over control-flow: 15.9% cases caught
   - Parameter sensitivity observable (T: 52.3%–70.6%)

4. **Limitations & Future Work**
   - **Missing:** Organizational metadata (roles, hierarchy)
   - **Missing:** Ground truth (validated violations)
   - **Missing:** Policy-aware conformance (integrate with process model)
   - **Future:** Extend to policy-aware/flow-integrated checking

5. **Transparent Framing**
   - "Results demonstrate catastrophic failure in senior approval detection"
   - "However, they provide preliminary evidence for policy-only checking"
   - "Next step: policy-aware conformance (Section X, future work)"
