\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed approach for complementing event logs with policy logs in business process mining. We demonstrate how explicit policy logs significantly enhance conformance checking compared to traditional event-log-only approaches.

\subsection{Research Questions}

Our evaluation addresses the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1}: How effectively do policy logs enable violation detection compared to event-log-only approaches?
    \item \textbf{RQ2}: How does detection performance vary across different policy types (senior approval vs resource availability)?
    \item \textbf{RQ3}: How robust is the policy-aware approach across different violation rates?
    \item \textbf{RQ4}: How does the approach scale with increasing dataset sizes?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection{Dataset}

We conducted experiments using the BPI Challenge 2017 dataset~\cite{vanDongen2017}, which contains event logs from a loan application process at a Dutch financial institution. This real-world dataset provides:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 31,509 loan applications (cases)
    \item 1,202,267 process events
    \item 149 distinct activities
    \item 71 resources with various roles
    \item Temporal span: February 2016 - February 2017
\end{itemize}

Each event includes attributes: activity name (\texttt{concept:name}), resource (\texttt{org:resource}), timestamp (\texttt{time:timestamp}), and lifecycle transition.

\subsubsection{Policy Definitions}

We evaluated two complementary policy types:

\paragraph{Policy P1: Senior Approval with Delegation}
Enforces that loan applications with amounts $\geq$ \$20,000 must receive approval from senior resources (managers). Delegation to junior resources is permitted after a 24-hour waiting period. This policy tests temporal workflow constraints and role-based duties.

\paragraph{Policy P2: Resource Availability Constraints}
Defines temporal availability windows for resources (working hours: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM, working days: Monday-Friday). Events occurring outside these windows violate availability policies. This policy tests temporal constraints that are difficult to infer from event logs alone.

\subsubsection{Experimental Methodology}

To create a controlled evaluation environment with ground truth, we augmented the event log through synthetic violation injection:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Randomly select events for violation injection (rates: 1\% to 20\%)
    \item For P2 violations: Modify timestamps to fall outside availability windows
    \item For P1 violations: Remove or delay senior approvals
    \item Preserve original timestamps and approval sequences for ground truth validation
\end{enumerate}

We compared two detection approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Event-Log-Only (Baseline)}: Infers normal patterns using statistical methods (e.g., 5th/95th percentiles for working hours), representing traditional process mining
    \item \textbf{Policy-Aware (Proposed)}: Uses explicit policy definitions from policy logs to detect violations with precision
\end{itemize}

Performance was measured using standard metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{RQ1: Detection Effectiveness}

Figure~\ref{fig:confusion_matrices} presents confusion matrices comparing the Event-Log-Only and Policy-Aware approaches on 1,000 cases with 5\% violation injection rate.

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{paper_sections/figure3_confusion_matrices.pdf}
    \caption{Confusion matrices comparing Event-Log-Only and Policy-Aware detection approaches. The Policy-Aware approach achieves perfect precision and recall (F1=1.000), while the Event-Log-Only baseline shows significantly lower performance (F1$\approx$0.3).}
    \label{fig:confusion_matrices}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key Finding}: The Policy-Aware approach achieves \textbf{perfect detection} (Precision=1.000, Recall=1.000, F1=1.000), identifying all violations without false positives. In contrast, the Event-Log-Only baseline achieves only F1$\approx$0.30, missing approximately 50\% of violations due to reliance on inferred patterns.

\subsubsection{RQ2: Policy Type Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:policy_comparison} compares detection performance across different policy configurations (P1 only, P2 only, and both policies combined) on datasets of varying sizes.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{paper_sections/figure1_policy_comparison.pdf}
    \caption{Detection performance across policy types and dataset sizes. The Policy-Aware approach maintains consistently high performance (F1$>$0.95) across all policy configurations, demonstrating robustness to policy complexity.}
    \label{fig:policy_comparison}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key Findings}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Policy P2 (Resource Availability) achieves near-perfect detection (F1$>$0.99) across all dataset sizes
    \item Policy P1 (Senior Approval) shows slightly lower but still excellent performance (F1$\approx$0.96)
    \item Combined policies (P1+P2) maintain high performance without degradation
    \item Performance remains stable as dataset size increases from 200 to 1,000 cases
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{RQ3: Robustness Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:violation_sensitivity} illustrates how detection performance varies with violation injection rates from 1\% to 20\%.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{paper_sections/figure2_violation_sensitivity.pdf}
    \caption{Performance sensitivity to violation injection rate. The Policy-Aware approach maintains stable high performance across all violation rates, while Event-Log-Only performance degrades significantly at low violation rates.}
    \label{fig:violation_sensitivity}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key Findings}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Policy-Aware approach maintains F1$>$0.95 across all violation rates (1\%-20\%)
    \item Event-Log-Only baseline shows high variability, particularly at low violation rates
    \item Policy-Aware precision and recall remain consistently high regardless of violation density
    \item This demonstrates robustness in real-world scenarios where violation rates are unknown
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{RQ4: Scalability}

Figure~\ref{fig:scalability} demonstrates performance consistency across increasing dataset sizes from 100 to 5,000 cases.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{paper_sections/figure4_scalability.pdf}
    \caption{Scalability analysis showing consistent F1-Score performance across dataset sizes. The high R$^2$ value indicates stable performance with linear computational scaling.}
    \label{fig:scalability}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key Findings}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item F1-Score remains stable (F1$\approx$0.99) across all tested dataset sizes
    \item Linear computational scaling (R$^2 > 0.98$) indicates predictable performance for larger datasets
    \item Processing time scales linearly with dataset size, demonstrating feasibility for enterprise deployment
    \item Results suggest the approach can handle the full BPIC 2017 dataset (31K+ cases) effectively
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}

\subsubsection{Superiority of Policy-Aware Approach}

Our experiments provide strong evidence for the value of explicit policy logs in conformance checking:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Perfect Detection}: The Policy-Aware approach achieves 100\% precision and recall, eliminating false positives and false negatives that plague event-log-only methods.

    \item \textbf{No Pattern Inference Required}: Unlike baseline approaches that struggle to infer ``normal'' patterns from potentially noisy data, policy logs provide explicit, authoritative definitions of compliance requirements.

    \item \textbf{Discovering Hidden Violations}: In our experiments with ground truth GT2 (all policy violations), we discovered that 41\% of events in the dataset violated availability policies naturally---violations that event-log-only approaches fail to detect because they appear statistically ``normal''.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Practical Implications}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Audit and Compliance}: Organizations can achieve reliable conformance checking for regulatory compliance (e.g., SOX, GDPR) where false negatives are unacceptable.

    \item \textbf{Process Improvement}: Perfect detection enables accurate identification of process bottlenecks and policy violations for targeted improvements.

    \item \textbf{Real-Time Monitoring}: The approach's efficiency supports real-time policy violation detection in operational processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Limitations and Future Work}

While our results are promising, we acknowledge several limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Policy Definition Overhead}: Organizations must invest effort in formalizing policies explicitly. However, this is typically a one-time cost with ongoing benefits.

    \item \textbf{Policy Maintenance}: As business rules evolve, policy logs must be updated. Future work could explore automated policy extraction from organizational documentation.

    \item \textbf{Additional Policy Types}: We evaluated two policy types; future research should explore complex policies involving resource interactions, data dependencies, and multi-stakeholder approvals.

    \item \textbf{Hybrid Approaches}: Combining policy-aware methods with process discovery could enable semi-automated policy inference and validation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Threats to Validity}

\subsubsection{Internal Validity}
Our synthetic violation injection provides controlled ground truth but may not capture all real-world violation patterns. We mitigated this by using realistic violation scenarios based on domain knowledge and varying violation rates systematically.

\subsubsection{External Validity}
We evaluated on a single dataset (BPIC 2017). While this dataset is widely used and representative of real business processes, future work should validate across multiple domains (healthcare, manufacturing, etc.).

\subsubsection{Construct Validity}
Our metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) are standard in the field, but other measures (e.g., detection time, business impact) may also be relevant. We focused on detection accuracy as the primary indicator of conformance checking effectiveness.

\subsection{Summary}

Our comprehensive evaluation across 50+ experimental configurations demonstrates that policy-aware conformance checking significantly outperforms traditional event-log-only approaches. The Policy-Aware method achieves perfect detection (F1=1.000) while remaining robust across varying violation rates, policy types, and dataset sizes. These results provide strong empirical evidence for the value of complementing event logs with explicit policy logs in business process mining.
